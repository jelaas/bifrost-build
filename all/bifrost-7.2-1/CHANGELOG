Bifrost 7.2: changes since 7.1.1
--------------------------------

- schedlat. Possibility to set process priority

TODO:
 - kernel 3.17. make sure latest initramfs >= 15
  - depmod. crashes with 3.16 ?
 - teamd
 - nftables
 - iptables
 - ethtool
 - HPSA module
 - import changes from 7.1.1 to 7.2
 - bifrost-upgrade. restart services after upgrade. detect (deleted)
   remount r after upgrade should be possible.
   Maybe let bifrost-upgrade take a tarball as argument.

 * extlinux for boot ?
   Solve compilation problems. Maybe easier in a new buildsystem.
 * modernization path for buildsystem ?
   The miniroots are getting long in the tooth.
   The new system should be contained within the old.

Bifrost 7.1.1: changes since 7.1

 initramfs support init=<initprg>

New since 6.x series.
---------------------

The Bifrost core distribution is now built completely from the bifrost-build system.
This means everything in the system is completely tracked. Sources, versions, build instructions and dependencies. See "https://github.com/jelaas/bifrost-build".

A new configure script based on dialog is now included. Makes basic system configuration a bit more fancier.

'devtag': Device tagging to keep track of devices. Currently only supports USB-devices. 

The included kernels (32 and 64 bit) are based on 3.0.0 from net-next.
Patches are:
- ixgbe RSS patch (free CPU 0 from bulk traffic)
- igxbe sfp patch (allow any sfp, not just intels)
- DOM support for ixgbe and igb (use ethtool to access)
- pktgen receiver patch (better statistics from pktgen)
- e1000 and e1000e copybreak patch
- slub_nomerge enabled by default
- niu bugfixes: rx_channel, rx_bytes
- backported bugfixes for fib_trie, ipv4/raw.c, inetpeer, niu and tcp_output.c.

Kernel modules are sorted into a few different packages: supported, unsupported, firmware, vmlinux and wireless.
"Supported" is the core package with kernel and the supported driver modules.
"Firmware" is for all firmware.
"Wireless" is for wireless device drivers.
"Vmlinux" is for the uncompressed kernel and system map.
"Unsupported" is for everything else not in the above categories..

Initramfs is used at boot time to find the boot partition by label, run fsck and then mount the boot partition. The initramfs is a cpio archive included in the kernel image.

ipmi support included (ipmitool).

A new script make_bifrost included to create new bootable bifrost storage devices.

/sbin/backup: the backup script is now configurable ('/etc/config.data/backup.conf').

A few utilities for namespace support: ns, nsnetif, veth, macvlan.

iocethtool: for generic ethtool ioctl access.

cpuinfo: script friendly cpu information.

ifinfo: script friendly network interface information.

cpu_pkts: monitor received packet distribution over cpus.

bifrost-upgrade: script to ease upgrading from a previous version of bifrost.

rfcmd: (for talking to tellsticks I believe).

tty_talk: sends command on serial port and prints response on stdout.

opt-get: very simple package downloader/installer.

New since 6.0.x series.
-----------------------

Static binaries. All binaries now linked statically against either uclibc or dietlibc. Dynamic libraries removed from system.

More old (hopefully not used anymore) cruft removed.

Support for loading drivers for misc hardware via device-detect.

Configuration now preserved better over upgrades. This is done via default files and setting default values to missing flags.

eth-affinity can now reserve CPUs from being used in the network receive and transmit path.

Daemons now run by default on CPU 0 which is freed from network traffic.

Namespace support added to kernel.

Bifrost can now with the help of 'allcaps'-program "boot" inside a namespace container. This in preparation for virtual router support.

Bifrost optional lxc package exists for doing basic container/namespace things.
http://laas.mine.nu/jens/bifrost/lxc-0.6.3-static.tgz


Initial DOM support for igb and ixgbe driver. Use inclused ethtool.
HW support for atom-based cpu's. 

32-bit kernel included for experiments and education. Also USB-to-ethernet 
gadget added.

eth-detect support for Intel cards 82599 added

l7 directory removed. Not supported. --ro


Bifrost 6.0  (Bifrost Software Distribution)
--------------------------------------------

Some of the news.

ftp://robur.slu.se:/pub/Linux/bifrost/v6/bifrost-6.0rc6.tgz

LABEL=bifrost is used for mounting and fsck of rootfs.

VLAN scripts are added. Contribution by Pehr Söderman <Pehrs@kth.se>
See /etc/docs/vlan-interfaces.txt.

New log possibilities, framework for coping logs between ramdisk and
USB-storage. See config.flags/ramlog. Also from Pehr.

Possible to control size of ramdisk. See config.data/tmpsize

Many utilities are updated and many are built with uclibc. There are new 
/bin64 and /bin32 directories included in PATH according to kernel arch. 
Scripts are cleaned up.

Kernel 2.6.29-r2 with many patches configured for 64-bit NUNA arch. Tested 
with Opteron and Intel Duo. So far we only support 64-bit kernel.

Kernel has multiqueue support for routing/forwarding. The driver supporting
multiqueue is ixgbe (Intel 10g 82598 chip) niu (SUN neptune 10g and 1g board)
and the igb (Intel 82576 chip) drivers.

Automatic driver module loading via PCI probing. See /etc/eth-detect.conf
(you can of course add needed tags). Modpobe follows eth-detect.conf order.

eth-affinity to setup IRQ affinity among multiqueue capable NIC's. Normally 
run at start.

ifstat2 is improved and have defaults for 10g.

'zile' --  A new emacs like editor.
'edit' now replaced with nano.

Some emerging support for TCAM classifier support in the niu driver via  
ethtool. (Note. A byte order bug for IP/Ports etc)

pktgen can be configured to use multiqueue NIC's.

An optional oprofile package can profile a running system at very little cost.
Very useful for troubleshooting and network and performance understanding.

And bugs of course

Enjoy
