 BUILD ENVIRONMENT FOR BIFROST
-------------------------------

A predictable and repeatable building environment for Bifrost binaries.
Consists of a uclibc mini-native chroot environment and a this package
of management and build scripts.

Each package is identified by source version and build script version.
A package may install dependencies in the form of other bifrost packages
from this build environment.

The 'pkg_build' script will ensure a clean environment (all installed
dependencies are uninstalled) before the package's own build script is run.

Installation:
-------------
Fetch the uclibc chroot tarball:
$ cd /tmp
$ wget http://uclibc.org/downloads/binaries/0.9.30.1/mini-native-i586.tar.bz2

Put into a suitable place:
$ mkdir /home/build
$ cd /home/build
$ tar xf /tmp/mini-native-i586.tar.bz2

Install this package:
$ mkdir -p mini-native-i586/var/lib
$ cd mini-native-i586/var/lib
$ git clone git://github.com/jelaas/bifrost-build.git build

Install helpful scripts:
$ cd build
$ cp -p util/chroot-i586.sh /home/build
$ cp -p util/chroot-setup.sh /home/build/mini-native-i586/bin

Now enter chroot:
$ cd /home/build
$ ./chroot-i586.sh
$ cd /var/lib/build

Start with building gnu tar:
$ ./pkg_build tar-1.23-1

Note: the first time you install a package or a build script installs a
dependency it will try to install GNU tar.

Build and install newer bash and (optionally) the zile editor:
$ ./pkg_build bash-4.1-1 zile-2.3.14-3 terminfo-5.7-1
$ ./pkg_install --permanent bash-4.1-1
$ ./pkg_install --permanent terminfo-5.7-1
$ ./pkg_install --permanent zile-2.3.14-2

Exit chroot:
$ exit

Done! The build environment is ready for use.

Usage:
------
$ cd /home/build
$ ./chroot-i586.sh
$ cd /var/lib/build

To build a package:
$ ./pkg_build <package-name>
or
$ ./pkg_build /path/that/is/ignored/<package-name>

The second way to give the package name is convenient when you use tab expansion.
You can begin by typing ./all/ and the tab expand to the package you want.

Package:
--------

Files in a package:
 Build.sh
 Fetch-source.sh

"Build.sh"
Configures, compiles and creates a package tarball which must be put in
'/var/spool/pkg/' and names '<package>.tar.gz'. Where package is the same
name as the directory under '/var/lib/build' that contains the package scripts.

"Fetch-source.sh"
Responsible for fetching any source files the package might need.
These should be put under '/var/spool/src'.

Example package:
----------------

The best way to create a new package is to copy the example scripts from
the package 'example-1.0.0-1', which is located under the staging directory.

The name of a package should be: "<application>-<version>-<build-version>".

After a package has been published and you wish to change the logic in the
scripts you need to create a new build-version for this. The same goes for
a new version of the source. This to ensure that the resulting build is
always identical.

The management scripts:
-----------------------

pkg_available:
 Help script for use by 'Build.sh'. It is there to help the user when more the
 package needs more than one dependency. pkg_available will report which
 dependencies need to be build (not recursively though).

pkg_build:
 Makes sure a working environment exists. Uninstalls any previously installed
 packages (dependencies). Calls the 'Build.sh' script for the package.
 
pkg_install:
 Installs a package. Keeps track of which files are installed. Also takes
 backup copies of any files that will be overwritten.

pkg_src_fetch:
 Calls 'Fetch-source.sh' for the package. This may be useful if you want to
 stock up on source files before starting building.

pkg_uninstall:
 Removes the packages files. Also reinstalls any files that were backuped.

pkg_depend:
 Display dependencies, forward or reverse.


Creating a package
------------------

While working on a new package there is a staging directory that is not
tracked by git ("/var/lib/build/staging").

$ cd /var/lib/build/staging
For a base package:
$ cp -a example-1.0.0-1 <pkg>-<version>-<build-version>
For an optional package:
$ cp -a opt-example-1.0.0-1 opt-<pkg>-<version>-<build-version>

Edit Fetch-source.sh.
Edit Build.sh.

Testrun:
$ /var/lib/build/pkg_build <pkg>-<version>-<build-version>

Dependencies
------------

A package may have a number of dependencies for building. These dependencies
may be in the form of libraries or utilities.
The build script 'Build.sh' must install these dependencies by using the
script 'pkg_install'. 'pkg_install' will keep track of what it installs so
everything can be retracted later by 'pkg_uninstall'.

Each build is supposed to start with a "clean" environment. Before each build
the 'pkg_build' script will run the 'pkg_uninstall' script.

__Important note_!!_
Be careful with the install part of making the package. Make sure that
for instance 'make install' wont install files under a real prefix into
the actual build environment. You might inadvertently insert unknown
dependencies into the environment.

Many package will support the DESTDIR variable for 'make install'.

You can use the pkg_depend script to find out existing dependencies.

Configuration
-------------

If the file /var/lib/build/conf/tmpfs contains "yes" then all building will
 be done within a tmpfs filesystem (mounted on /var/tmp/src).
